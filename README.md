# IP Geolocation App

This is a simple web application that retrieves the public IP address and geolocation data using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

2. The application will automatically fetch the public IP address and corresponding geolocation data.

3. The geolocation data will be displayed on the page, including details such as city, country, and other available information.

## Files

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the web page.

- **styles.css**: The CSS file for styling the web page.

- **app.js**: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for fetching IP and geolocation data and updating the UI.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the application based on your needs. You can modify the styling in `styles.css` or enhance the UI in `index.html`. Additionally, you might want to explore other geolocation APIs for more detailed information.

## Notes

- The application uses the [httpbin.org](https://httpbin.org) service to retrieve the public IP address.

- Geolocation data is obtained from the [ipapi](https://ipapi.co) API.

- Make sure your internet connection is active for the application to work properly.
